# Cal Poly Server Compile

Works on mac, might need to be tweaked for windows/linux

## Usage

Edit 'user' and 'password' in run_on_server.sh to your cal poly username and password (don't commit this)

$ chmod +x run_on_server.sh

$ chmod +x server_login.expect

$ ./run_on_server.sh hello_world.c

## Output

"output" and "error" will appear in the folder you ran it in and will contain the server output and error of the program that was run.
